### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Eugenia
#### Software Engineer
I am a software engineer with experience in software companies, having worked with colleagues from around the world. My first language is Spanish; however, I am accustomed to communicating, attending meetings, and writing emails and documentation in English. I have worked with both English native speakers and individuals who speak English as a second language for the past ten years. I have a track record of adapting to new projects, technologies, and programming languages, which has allowed me to work with various technology stacks throughout my career. 

Skills: NODE / REACT / MONGO / JENKINS
